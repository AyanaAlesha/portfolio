            <h3>Guess The Number Game</h3>
            <p> The user inputs a number between 0 and 100.
                A random number is generated by Math.random() and compared to the user's guess.
                The program displays whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. You can also link to the live demo and the GitHub repository.</p>

            <h3> Crescent Pizza </h3>
            <p> This JavaScript project is a simple pizza order calculator that allows users
                 to select different types of pizzas, specify the quantity, 
                 and then calculate the total cost of their order. 
                 The results display the details of the selected pizzas,
                 including their names, quantities, and individual totals, 
                 along with the final price of the entire order. </p>
                
            <p>   Technologies:
                
                    HTML: The structure of the page includes checkboxes for pizza types and input fields for quantities.
                    JavaScript: Handles the logic of calculating the order total based on the user's selections and displays the results on the page.
             </p>   
            <p>    How it Works:
                
                    Pizza Selection: Users are presented with a list of pizzas (e.g., Pepperoni, Meat Lovers, Cheese, Supreme).
                    Quantity Input: For each pizza, users can specify how many pizzas they want.
                    Calculation: When the user clicks the "Calculate Order" button, the script checks which pizzas are selected, calculates the total for each pizza (price × quantity), 
                    and sums up the total cost.
                    Output: The selected pizzas and their respective quantities and 
                    prices are displayed along with the final total cost.</p>

           <h3> Calculator program</h3>
               <p> A calculator program is a software application 
                   designed to perform arithmetic operations and 
                   sometimes advanced mathematical functions. 
                   Its main purpose is to help users perform calculations
                   efficiently. Here are some key elements to describe a basic calculator 
                   program: </p>

                    <p>User Interface: The program typically has a clean and
                        user-friendly interface with buttons for digits (0-9),
                        basic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
                        division), a clear button, and possibly a decimal point. </p>

                       <p> Functionality:
                            Basic Arithmetic: The program can perform simple calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
                            Clear or Reset: A button to reset the calculator display and start a new calculation.
                            Decimal Point: Allows for operations with decimal numbers.
                            Chain Calculations: The program can handle multiple operations 
                           in a sequence without requiring the user to start over. </p>

                      <p>  Display: A screen or display area shows the current input, 
                          ongoing calculations, and the final result. </p>

                      <p>  Error Handling: Displays messages or handles situations
                          like division by zero gracefully. </p>

                      <p> Programming Logic: The program may be coded with a 
                          backend logic that captures user input, performs operations 
                          in the correct order, and displays results. It can use 
                          functions or methods for each arithmetic operation, 
                          with a central function to handle the calculations 
                          based on user input.</p>

                <h3> Memory Card Game </h3>
                    <p> This is a fun and interactive Memory Card Game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. 
                        It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges memory skills by randomizing card positions each round.</p>
                    <p>Gameplay:
                        In the Memory Card Game, the player flips two cards at a time, trying to match pairs. 
                        If the cards match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over after a short delay. 
                        The goal is to match all pairs with the fewest number of attempts. </p>
                    <p>Features:

                                Randomized card positions each game to increase replayability.
                                Score Counter updates with each match found.
                                Next Level Alert when all pairs are matched, encouraging continued gameplay.
                                Emoji and Color Matching for visual variety.
                                Responsive Design so it plays well on different screen sizes.</p>

                <p> How to Play:

                            Open the game and start by flipping any card to reveal it.
                            Flip a second card to try to find a matching pair.
                            If the two cards match, they will stay flipped and your score will increase.
                            If the two cards don’t match, they will flip back after a brief delay.
                            Continue flipping cards to match all pairs. Once all pairs are matched, a prompt will appear to start the next level.</p>
                <p>Technologies Used:

                            HTML: Markup structure for the game.
                            CSS: Styling and layout for the game interface.
                            JavaScript: Logic for the card-flipping mechanics, matching logic, and score tracking.</p>

                <p> Future Enhancements:

                        Some features we aim to add in the future:

                            Timed Rounds: Add a timer to create more challenging levels.
                            Leaderboard: Track high scores for competitive play.
                            Sound Effects: Add sounds for card flips and matches.
                            More Levels: Additional levels with different difficulties and card types.</p>
